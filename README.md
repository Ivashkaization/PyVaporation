# PVmodelling

This solution is designed specifically to assist Researchers in the field of Pervaporation membranes development.
By means of the proposed instrument one can easily model a performance of a particular membrane with known permeance (Pi) and appearing energy of activiation  of transport (Ea) values for each component of a considered binary mixture. 

# The Following mixtures are Currently supported:

* H2O/EtOH
* H2O/IPOH
* MeOH/toluene
* MeOH/p-Xylene
* MeOH/Methyl-tertbuthyl ether
* MeOH/DimethoxyEthane
* MeOH/Dimethylcarbonate
* MeOH/CycloHexane
* MeOH/Benzene
