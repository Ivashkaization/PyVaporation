# PVmodelling
This solution is designed specifically to assist Researchers in the field of Pervaporation membranes development.
By means of the proposed instrument one can easily model a performance of a particular membrane with known permeance (Pi) and appearing energy of activiation  of transport (Ea) for a considered binary mixture. 
following mixtures are Currently  supported:
H2O/EtOH
