# PVmodelling

This solution is designed specifically to assist Researchers in the field of Pervaporation membranes development.
By means of the proposed instrument one can easily model a performance of a particular membrane with known permeance (Pi) and appearing energy of activiation  of transport (Ea) values for each component of a considered binary mixture. 

# The Following mixtures are Currently built in the solution:

binary:

* H2O/MeOH
* H2O/EtOH
* H2O/IPOH
* MeOH/toluene
* MeOH/Methyl-tertbuthyl ether
* MeOH/DimethoxyEthane
* MeOH/Dimethylcarbonate
* MeOH/CycloHexane


# Assumptions and applicability

The solution is designed to model isothermal pervaporation process and could compute the composition of the feed mixture in relation to the process time (or module lenght). All the calculations could be considered valid if in the studied compositions range permeance values are constant. There is also an extension which could allow one to predict the change on permeance value in the "facillitated" transport regime, however this should be used carefully, as this may not work for a particular membrane picked for the modelling.
